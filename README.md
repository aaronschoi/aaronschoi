## Software Dev

Just got my certification (June 2021) in Software Engineering with Thinkful -- a Chegg company. In this program, I worked in teams every week for five months to build projects and learn concepts the Fullstack PERN developer needs to know to be successful in the industry.

When I love something, I can literally just sit there for hours on end digging into and seeing how I can make something happen.

## 🌟💭💥 The Dream 💥💭🌟

- automate parts of my life to make time for things that matter most
- find open source communities devoted to delivering content to families with members affected with disabilities ~~~ especially families with children (major proponent of early intervention)
